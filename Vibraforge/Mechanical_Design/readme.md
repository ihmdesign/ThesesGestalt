This folder contains CAD files for control units and vibration units. In our lab environment, parts are printed with PLA materials using 0.4mm nozzles on [Bambu Lab X1C 3D Printer](store.bambulab.com/collections/3d-printer/products/x1-carbon). Other printers with higher precision should also satisfy the requirements.
